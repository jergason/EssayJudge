One of the fundamental flaws with posting your essay online to be reviewed is that someone can copy it and turn it in on their own.
<br><br>
<b>Students</b>, here are a few tips to help prove you are the author:
<ul>
<li>	Select a username that can identify you.  If your name is John Smith, pick the username JohnS.
<li>	Mention your name, class, period, date and school in the heading of your essay.
<li>	Remember your password!  If a teacher suspects you copied your essay from EssayJudge, prove it was your essay by logging into the site.
<li>	Mention that you posted on EssayJudge when you submit your essay.  This will show your teacher that you have nothing to hide.
</ul>
<b>Teachers</b>, if you see a student's essay on EssayJudge, here are a few ways to tell if he/she is the original author:
<ul>
<li>	Ask her to log into the site in front of you.  If she can log in and show you the essay to you, it is clearly her own work.
<li>	If he doesn't remember his username/password, ask him to log in from home and add a message to the top of the essay.  If he can’t, he probably didn’t originally post the essay.
</ul>
